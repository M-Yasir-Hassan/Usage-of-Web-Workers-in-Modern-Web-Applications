#Weather App with AJAX
This repository contains the code for a simple web application that fetches and displays weather information based on a user's input (city name) using AJAX.

#Features:

User-friendly interface with a text field for city input and a button to trigger the data fetch.
AJAX functionality to retrieve weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API without page reloads.
Structured display of fetched data including location, temperature, description, and an icon.
Error handling for invalid city names, API errors, and rate limits.

#Technologies Used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
AJAX
OpenWeatherMap API (or alternative based on needs)

#Setup:
Clone the repository.
Replace YOUR_API_KEY in script.js with your OpenWeatherMap API key.
Open index.html in a web browser.

#Running the Application:
Enter a city name in the text field.
Click the "Get Weather" button.
The weather information for the specified city will be displayed.

#Contributing:
Feel free to fork this repository and contribute your improvements. Pull requests are welcome!

#Additional Notes:
Keep your API key confidential and do not expose it in the code.
Free API tiers often have rate limits, so consider usage adjustments or alternative APIs for high-traffic applications.
This project serves as a starting point and can be extended with additional features and functionalities.
I hope this README file provides a comprehensive overview of the project. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
