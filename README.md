# Description:

This project demonstrates the use of Web Workers in a data processing application. The application generates and sorts large arrays in the background to showcase the performance benefits of using Web Workers.

# Instructions to Run Locally:

Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory: cd <project-directory>
Open index.html in your web browser.
# Performance Improvements:
Using Web Workers allows the application to offload heavy data processing tasks to a separate thread, preventing UI thread blocking. This results in a smoother user experience, especially when dealing with computationally intensive tasks like sorting large arrays.

# Challenges Faced:

Data Generation:

Challenge: Generating and sorting large datasets efficiently.
Solution: Implemented a function (generateLargeArray) to create arrays with 10 million random numbers for testing.
Web Worker Communication:

Challenge: Communicating between the main thread and Web Worker.
Solution: Used the postMessage method for data transfer and set up event listeners to handle messages.
UI Responsiveness:

Challenge: Ensuring the UI remains responsive during data processing.
Solution: Displayed a loading message during processing to indicate ongoing tasks.
# Summary:
Web Workers significantly enhance the performance of data-intensive tasks, as demonstrated in this project. The README provides clear instructions for running the project locally and highlights key findings and challenges faced during development.
